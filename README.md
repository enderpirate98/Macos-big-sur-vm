dubble click the exe file and go through the installation

go into tools -> preferences -> extensions and add the extension pack going through any prompts necessary

Setting up the hardware:

create a new virtual machine and name it Big Sur (naming this is easier for later steps but you can name it something else if you like)

the type should be "MAC OS X" and the version should be "10.13 high sierra (64-bit)"

click next 

the amount of ram can be what you want it to be but do at least 8GB for a smooth experience (most moddern systems have 12 or 16 GB and if you less than that please upgrade)

create a new virtual hard disk and choose "VDH" the storage itself should be dynamically allocated

the disk size can be as big as you want it to be but it does have to be at least 80GB

hit create and exit virtual box

go into the command prompt and run it as administrator

if you have an intel processor then copy and paste the commands from intel-code.txt (if your vm name is not Big Sur then change Big Sur to what your vm name is)

if you have an amd processor then copy and paste the commands from amd-code.txt (if your vm name is not Big Sur then change Big Sur to what your vm name is)

open virtualbox and go into

it will say that there is no
